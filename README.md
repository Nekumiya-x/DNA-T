DNA-T: Deformable Neighborhood Attention Transformer for Irregular Medical Time Series

This paper proposes a novel Deformable Neighborhood Attention Transformer (DNA-T) for irregular medical time series. The proposed Missingness-Aware Embedding layer integrates the timestamps, masks, and intervals to model the missing patterns, which are used to enhance the latent representation of the time series. In addition, a new DNA module is designed that is able to flexibly select relevant neighborhoods using the missing patterns of the neighborhoods at each time point.
